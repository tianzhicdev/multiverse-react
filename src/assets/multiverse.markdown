We use the collected information to:
- Provide the App’s core functionality, such as processing uploaded images through third-party APIs to generate art-style images.
- Manage your account, authenticate access, process subscriptions and credit purchases, and provide customer support.

## Sharing Your Information
We may share your information with:
- **Third-Party Service Providers:** We use third-party APIs to process your uploaded images. These providers have access to your images solely for generating art styles and are bound by their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.
- **Analytics Providers:** We use tools like Google Analytics to analyze usage data, which may collect your IP address, device information, and app usage patterns.
- **Legal Authorities:** We may disclose your information if required by law or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of others.
- **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred to a successor entity.

We ensure that third parties with whom we share your data provide equivalent protection as outlined in this policy.

## Your Rights
You have the following rights regarding your personal information:
- **Access:** Request access to the personal information we hold about you.
- **Correction:** Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete information.
- **Deletion:** Request deletion of your personal information, subject to legal retention requirements.
- **Opt-Out:** Opt out of promotional communications by following unsubscribe instructions or contacting us.

To exercise these rights, contact us at [info@multiverseai.app](mailto:info@multiverseai.app). You may also delete your account directly in the App’s settings, which will remove your personal information, except for data we must retain for legal purposes. We will respond to requests within 30 days.

## Tracking Technologies
We use third-party Software Development Kits (SDKs) for analytics and performance monitoring. These SDKs may collect device and usage data. You can opt out of certain tracking by adjusting your device settings (e.g., iOS: Settings > Privacy > Tracking; Android: Settings > Privacy > Ads).

## Data Security
We implement industry-standard security measures, including encryption of data in transit and at rest, to protect your personal information. Access to your data is restricted to authorized personnel. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You share data at your own risk, particularly when posting to social media.

## Data Retention
- **Account Information:** Retained for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services.
- **Uploaded Images:** Processed and deleted immediately after generation, unless saved in your account.
- **Saved Images:** Retained until you delete them or close your account.
- **Usage Data:** Retained in anonymized form for analytics unless you request deletion.

We may retain data longer to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements.

## International Data Transfers
Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your own, such as the United States, where our third-party service providers operate. We use safeguards like Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure your data is protected in accordance with this policy. For more information, contact [info@multiverseai.app](mailto:info@multiverseai.app).
